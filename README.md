In a comprehensive data analysis project, I led the implementation of the Random Forest algorithm to predict customer satisfaction on an airline dataset with the best accuracy score of 95.38%. My role in this project embraced comprehensive data preprocessing, model training, and development of predictive models that identify factors leading to customer satisfaction. Using Tableau, I created insightful visualizations that effectively show the trends of customer satisfaction with various metrics of flight experience. The output from this analysis gave insightful recommendations for service improvement and improved customer retention strategies.# Airline-Passenger-Satisfaction
